# Bank-Transactions-Simulator
The program will simulate a banking system where multiple users transactions concurrently on a shared account.

In this application I will consider the next requirements:
  1) Deposit money.
  2) Withdraw money (if the account has sufficient founds)
  3) Check the account balance

The application will show the results of each actions by console.

As an improvement to the project, I added the functionality for both the users and the number of tasks each one performs to be entered from the console, to make the application easier to use. 
I encountered some issues when displaying the results, but by searching for documentation, I was able to solve them.

CONFIGURATION:

 cStandard: "c17",
 cppStandard: "c++17",
 intelliSenseMode: "gcc-x64"
 Visual Studio 2019
